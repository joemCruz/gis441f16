# Potential Projects

Your course project will be required to extend one of the development efforts in geovisualization currently underway as part of various research projects at ASU. This document is intended to provide a brief overview of the projects. Details on each project regarding how you may enhance and further the develop the effort to form you course project will be discussed in our class meetings.
 
For each project a list of suggested possible extensions are offered. These are not exhuastive but are intended to give you some idea of the nature of each project. Once you select a project these should be viewed as points of departure for defining the project.  The final scope of your project will be subject to approval later on in the semester.


In addition to the discussion of the projects provided in class, you are encouraged to explore the code repositories listed for each project and to review any development discussions that are happening on the project's issue tracker or in pull requests submitted to the project.

You will have to select your project by class meeting time on September 6. These are individual projects so the first student to submit a pull request indicating their interest in claiming the project will be assigned as such. To indicate your interest in a project, enter your name next to the **Student**: field below the project and submit a pull request with that change.
