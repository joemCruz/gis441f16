# Requirements Analysis Document
# Pysal - QGis Integration

### 1. Introduction
  1. Purpose
  Pysal contains methods for Markov chains and concordance measures that it inherited from the STARS Package. These methods will be improved and new space-time indicators will be added to the spatial dynamics module of Pysal.
  
  Pysal - QGis Integration intends to allow the integration of certain portions of the Pysal library within the GIS system, QGis. 
  2. Scope of your package
  Users of the software Pysal.
  Users of the software QGis.
  3. Objectives and success metrics 
  The update of the spatial dynamics module will be considered successful when
  Pysal and QGis can be considered successfully integrated when the (elements specified) can be accessed and utilized within QGis with readable and meaningful results.

### 2. Current System
  1. Description of existing project
  PySAL is an open source library of spatial analysis functions written in Python intended to support the development of high level applications. PySAL is open source under the BSD License. [Pysal Link](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  
  QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) licensed under the GNU General Public License. [QGis Link](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/about/index.html)
  2. How does the project extend existing work
  The project extends the functionality inherent within Pysal into the QGis platform. This allows for functions not found within QGis, but found within Pysal, to be used in Qgis' graphical interface.
